# Bike Sales Excel Dashboard
<br>
This is a simple dashboard Excel project using bike sales data.
<br><br>
Excel features used and learned in this project:<br>
•	Duplicate data removed from data set.<br>
•	Find and Replace (Ctrl + H on Windows) to replace M and S with Married and Single under the marital status columns to provide better clarity.<br>
•	Changed the Income column from General to Currency.<br>
•	Added “Age Brackets” column that groups data based on the value in the “Age” column for the sake of a better visualization.<br>
•	Created a Pivot Table based on Gender, Average Income, and whether they purchased a bike or not (yes/no). This was primarily to see if average income played a role in purchasing a bike.<br>
•	Created a second Pivot Table based on customer’s commute distance to see if it affected whether they purchased a bike or not.<br>
•	Created a third Pivot Table with the newly added Age Brackets column to see if age affects whether someone purchases a bike or not.<br>
•	Created a Dashboard using the Pivot Tables with Slicers for Marital Status, Education, and Region.<br>
